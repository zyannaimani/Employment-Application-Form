                Notice to Applicant: All information requested is relevant and important to making a hiring decision.
                AN INCOMPLETE APPLICATION WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. <br> <br>

                We will verify the information you provide. Intentionally withholding or misrepresenting information could result in rejection 
                for employment, or if employed, termination from the company. <br> <br>

                Please be advised: TUTOR RESPONSIBILITIES are twofold. As a tutor, you will be assigned students. Your first responsibility will be to help the students learn the course material. This usually means working with them on a one-to-one basis or in a small group. Working with students requires tremendous patience. 
                When a student asks a question, the most effective way to work is to first explain the concept in a straightforward manner, do an example demonstrating how that skill works, and lastly, guide them through two or three examples, not actually telling them what to do, but allowing the students to struggle a bit with the problem, giving hints along the way. 
                The second responsibility of a tutor is that of record keeping. Accurate, neat, up-to-date records are absolutely necessary and vital. At first, the paperwork may seem to be a lot, but it can be taken care of during the hour in about 5-6 minutes. The importance of the second part of the job should never be minimized.
